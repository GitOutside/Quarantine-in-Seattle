        <h1>Pacific Tower</h1>
        <p>I took Rudie to the off-leash dog park at Jose Rizal Park, which is on the hillside just below the imposing Pacific Tower. The building sits on the north end of Beacon Hill and lords over SODO, downtown and beyond to Elliot Bay.</p>
        <p>I have always loved this building, with its Art Deco majesty and uplights that give it a dramatic presence at night. To my delight, I discovered that the campus is open to the public, so we took a stroll through.</p>
